    <h1>The other spec — Internationalization in JavaScript</h1>
<p>Unless you have been living under a rock, you would have noticed the gradual advances being made lately in the field of internationalization. This is especially important for you if you're a web developer since the pervasiveness of the web is somewhat lost if you fail to appeal to the crowd you become accessible to.</p>
