                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p class="lead">Hello, Guten Tag and Здравствуйте. I am Ujjwal Sharma, an Indian teenage University student. I love tinkering with things, and I definitely love to make <em>(and as of recently, break <strong>into</strong>)</em>                        stuff. Also, I am <abbr title="I find myself at a loss when asked to differentiate between light green and pale green">colorblind</abbr>.</p>
                    <p>It would be really stupid of me if I mentioned that I am an enthusiast of free speech and universal human rights <em>(who isn't?)</em>. I am a supporter of Open Source Software and of the Open Access Movement. I belive that Information,
                        Knowledge and Education are the most important stations for human civilization, and not only should they be open to all people alike, but they should be also open to recantation and improvement.</p>
                    <p>I have been studying computers and programming since forever <em>(it seems)</em> but I really came into the scene during high-school, when I started learning Game Programming in C# and UnityScript (Unity's Ancient Javascript) for fun.
                        That was when I realized that <del>I am really creative</del> it was really wonderful and fun making stuff with computers and programming.</p>
                    <p>At the moment, I do Web Design, Web Development using Ruby on Rails, Python Scripting and anything else that seems fun. Also, for those curious on why is discontinued Game Development: Lack of Art. Seriously. There's only so little
                        a coder can do developing games without 3D designers to maintain him a fresh supply of needed art, and I was always really bad at Photoshop.</p>

                <header class="pac text-center panel-heading">
                    <h1>Contact Me</h1> </header>
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p class="lead">By now, I have made all my strength and especially my weaknesses evident. If you ever feel the need to meet a person of my indominable stupidity, I will be leaving an address for you to post your letters to. Also, you might need to
                        someday contact me either to take care of your distress, or some shady stuff like summoning the dark brotherhood.</p>
                    <p><strong>Disclaimer: In case you choose to contact me using any of the mediums mentioned below, do not forget to say "Hi!". If in case you fail to do so, You will be sorely ignored and probably left for the carrion scavengers. Good Luck.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>So, the methods you can use to contact me in increasing probability of me not getting your message are: </p>
                    <h3>METHOD 1 <small>Level: Novice</small></h3>
                    <p>Email me at <a href="mailto:usharma1998@gmail.com" class="label label-primary" target="_blank">usharma1998@gmail.com</a> in case you don't end up landing with the trash, I'll hear you. <strong>Just kidding, I read every single one of my mail. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <h3>METHOD 2 <small>Level: Apprentice</small></h3>
                    <p>Follow me on Github, Twitter or Tumblr <em>(I'm not exactly there 24x7, but I would probably get a notification)</em> or flash an SOS signal.</p>
                    <h3>METHOD 3 <small>Level: Adept</small></h3>
                    <p>Because I usually lurk around Reddit to have my daily dose of crazy and hilarious cat pictures, it just might be a good idea to send a message to my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zyoki/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> account. <strong>Please don't ask me why my username on Reddit is 'zyoki', it just brings back painful memories.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <h3>METHOD 4 <small>Level: Expert</small></h3>
                    <p>Although this could have been the method one some time ago, adding me on steam and sending me messages has quickly lost its usefulness, probably because I haven't played for quite some time now.</p>
                    <p>So, add me on Steam using the link above, and don't forget to say "hi!"</p>
                    <p>Also, the same story holds true for <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/zyoki/profile" target="_blank">Twitch.tv</a>
                    </p>
                    <h3>METHOD 5 <small>Level: Master</small></h3>
                    <p>Lurk into some of the IRC servers (Freenode, QuakeNet, AnonOps, etc.) <em>Yes. All the channels.</em> And look for me. No, I am not giving you my username. It will be something like trying to find a Classical Song on Google.</p><img

                    <h3>METHOD 5 <small>Level: Legendary</small></h3>
                    <p><abbr title="The Black Sacrament is a ritual performed by one who wishes to contact the Dark Brotherhood, usually in the hopes of having a murder-contract satisfied by one of their assassins.">Perform the <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Sacrament" target="_blank">Black Sacrament</a></abbr>.
                        Seriously. Athough this should always be the last straw.</p>
