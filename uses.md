# Stuff I Use

Am I missing something that you'd like to know? [Hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=453076986) and let me know. I'd be happy to add anything I might have missed out.

## Code

1. **Editor**: I use [Visual Studio Code Insiders Edition](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) for the awesome community and ecosystem, but I'm still not quite over Vim's awesome keybindings, so I use [VSCodeVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) to emulate the essential keybindings and a few life-saving plugins.
2. **Terminal Emulator**: I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) and it works perfectly for me. I've tried to use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) multiple times in the past but I keep coming back to iTerm2 for some reason.
3. **Language Server**: I use Microsoft's [vscode-cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) as my language server of choice since it pretty much does everything with little to no configuration and *just works*™️. I used to use [cquery](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery) and [vscode-cquery](https://github.com/cquery-project/vscode-cquery) previously for obvious reasons, but I don't think I need it anymore.

## Aesthetic

1. **Shell**: I use [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) as my default login shell with the [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) framework and the [bureau](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes#bureau) prompt.
2. **Color Theme**: I have tried so many color themes in the past, but every since the days of Sublime Text 3, I always find myself coming back to Ayu's Mirage flavor. Currently I am using [vscode-ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme/vscode-ayu) in VSCode and [an Ayu adaptation for iTerm2](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/blob/master/schemes/ayu.itermcolors) for the terminal.
